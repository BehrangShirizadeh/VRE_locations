# VRE_locations
The location of taken VRE profiles in the EOLES models (for each county of France)
The capacity ratio of each of solar PV and Onshore wind for each county is used to prepare single VRE profile for the whole country, taking a weighted average.
Offshore profiles are prepared by taking mean of the projects that are marked "yes", and they are separated by "floating" or "grounded" installation types.
